# anyline-receipt-detection
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/alex-schwartzman/anyline-receipt-detection.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alex-schwartzman/anyline-receipt-detection)

Sample app, doing receipt detection, automatic snapshot and crop.

## Limitations:
For the moment, only receipts with aspect ratio 2:3 are supported, see [document_view_config.json](https://github.com/alex-schwartzman/anyline-receipt-detection/blob/master/app/src/main/assets/document_view_config.json)

## Purpose:
Ideally, this app should not only detect receipt of arbitrary aspect ratio, but, as well read total amount out of it. Please, feel free to help out and implement missing features.
